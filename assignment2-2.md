## 1. Description

The aim of this assignment is to analyze the factors influencing the number of views on YouTube using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). By identifying these factors, content creators can develop strategies to boost their viewership. 

The analysis will consider elements such as:
- Thumbnails
- Tags
- Descriptions
- Posting times

Please refer to Table I in the paper [1]. PCA will be utilized to pinpoint the most significant factors, while SVM will predict and classify their impact on viewership. In this assignment, you will analyze data from various YouTube channels to identify the factors that influence the number of views on YouTube videos.
