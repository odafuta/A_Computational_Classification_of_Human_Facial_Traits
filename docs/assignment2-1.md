# Assignment 2: Which Animal Are You?
## A Computational Classification of Human Facial Traits

## 1. Description

The aim of this assignment is to analyze the resemblance of human faces to specific animals using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). By mapping human facial features to animal-like traits, we explore how subjective impressions (such as having a "cat-like" or "dog-like" face) can be modeled computationally. This has potential applications in entertainment, avatar generation, and sociocultural studies.

PCA is employed to reduce the high-dimensional pixel data into a small number of components that capture the most significant variations in facial features. SVM is then used to classify each face into one of the predefined animal categories based on these components.

In this assignment, you will train a classifier to recognize which animal a given human face most closely resembles. A new test image can then be projected into this feature space to determine its corresponding animal class.
